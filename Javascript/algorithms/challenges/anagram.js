// ************************* ANAGRAM CHALLENGE FROM HACKER RANK *********************************** //

/**
Two words are anagrams of one another if their letters can be rearranged to form the other word.

  Given a string, split it into two contiguous substrings of equal length. Determine the minimum
  number of characters to change to make the two substrings into anagrams of one another.

  Example
 s=abccde
Break s into two parts: 'abc' and 'cde'. Note that all letters have been used, the substrings are contiguous
 and their lengths are equal. Now you can change 'a' and 'b' in the first substring to 'd' and 'e' to have 'dec' and 'cde'
 which are anagrams. Two changes were necessary.

  Function Description

Complete the anagram function in the editor below.

  anagram has the following parameter(s):

string s: a string

Returns

int: the minimum number of characters to change or -1.

Input Format

The first line will contain an integer, q,
 the number of test cases.
  Each test case will contain a string s

  Constraints

consists only of characters in the range ascii[a-z].

  Sample Input

6
aaabbb
ab
abc
mnop
xyyx
xaxbbbxx

Sample Output

3
1
-1
2
0
1

Explanation

Test Case #01: We split
into two strings ='aaa' and ='bbb'. We have to replace all three characters from the first string with 'b' to make the strings anagrams.

  Test Case #02: You have to replace 'a' with 'b', which will generate "bb".

  Test Case #03: It is not possible for two strings of unequal length to be anagrams of one another.

  Test Case #04: We have to replace both the characters of first string ("mn") to make it an anagram of the other one.

  Test Case #05: and are already anagrams of one another.

  Test Case #06: Here S1 = "xaxb" and S2 = "bbxx". You must replace 'a' from S1 with 'b' so that S1 = "xbxb"

/**
 * We consider two strings to be anagrams of each other if the first string's letters can be rearranged to

 * Alice is taking a cryptography class and finding anagrams to be very useful. She decides on an encryption scheme involving two large strings where encryption is dependent on the minimum number of character deletions required to make the two strings anagrams. Can you help her find this number?
 *
 * Given two strings,
 * and , that may not be of the same length, determine the minimum number of character deletions required to make and

 *
 * Example.

 Dothraki are planning an attack to usurp King Robert's throne. King Robert learns of this conspiracy from Raven and
 plans to lock the single door through which the enemy can enter his kingdom.
 But, to lock the door he needs a key that is an anagram of a palindrome.
 He starts to go through his box of strings, checking to see if they can be rearranged into a palindrome.
 Given a string, determine if it can be rearranged into a palindrome. Return the string YES or NO.
 Example
 s=aabbccdd
 One way this can be arranged into a palindrome is abcddcba. Return YES.
